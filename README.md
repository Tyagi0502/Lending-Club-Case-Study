## General Information
- This project was done as an assignment for Executive PG Programme in Machine Learning, Upgrad and IIITB
- The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
- The data contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not.

## Conclusions

* A lower annual income suggests higher chance of default.

* Higher DTI (debt to income ratio) suggests higher chance of default.

* There is an increased chance of default when purpose is small_business

* Higher loan amount results in higher chance of default, except when purpose is moving, house or renewable energy

* Above annual income of about 90,000 there is a high chance that the loan will be paid off.

* There is a good chance of loan repayment when the loan amount is higher than 28000.

* When purpose of loan is 'moving', sost number of defaults happen when loan is disbursed between May and September
